BreachDepressions
This tool can be used to remove the depressions in a digital elevation model (DEM), a common requirement of spatial hydrological operations such as flow accumulation and watershed modelling. The tool based on the efficient hybrid depression breaching algorithm described by Lindsay (2016). It uses a breach-first, fill-second approach to resolving continuous flowpaths through depressions.

Notice that when the input DEM (--dem) contains deep, single-cell pits, it can be useful to raise the pits elevation to that of the lowest neighbour (--fill_pits), to avoid the creation of deep breach trenches. Deep pits can be common in DEMs containing speckle-type noise. This option, however, does add slightly to the computation time of the tool.

The user may optionally (--flat_increment) override the default value applied to increment elevations on flat areas (often formed by the subsequent depression filling operation). The default value is dependent upon the elevation range in the input DEM and is generally a very small elevation value (e.g. 0.001). It may be necessary to override the default elevation increment value in landscapes where there are extensive flat areas resulting from depression filling (and along breach channels). Values in the range 0.00001 to 0.01 are generally appropriate. increment values that are too large can result in obvious artifacts along flattened sites, which may extend beyond the flats, and values that are too small (i.e. smaller than the numerical precision) may result in the presence of grid cells with no downslope neighbour in the output DEM. The output DEM will always use 64-bit floating point values for storing elevations because of the need to precisely represent small elevation differences along flats. Therefore, if the input DEM is stored at a lower level of precision (e.g. 32-bit floating point elevations), this may result in a doubling of the size of the DEM.

In comparison with the BreachDepressionsLeastCost tool, this breaching method often provides a less satisfactory, higher impact, breaching solution and is often less efficient. It has been provided to users for legacy reasons and it is advisable that users try the BreachDepressionsLeastCost tool to remove depressions from their DEMs first. The BreachDepressionsLeastCost tool is particularly well suited to breaching through road embankments. Nonetheless, there are applications for which full depression filling using the FillDepressions tool may be preferred.
