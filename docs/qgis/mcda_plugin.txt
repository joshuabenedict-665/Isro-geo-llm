# MCDA Plugin for QGIS (Multi‑Criteria Decision Analysis)

MCDA plugins support weighted raster overlay for site suitability.

## Key Features:
- **School Placement (MCDA)**: tailored for educational site analysis.
- **RasterMCDA / WMCA**: generic weighted overlay of multiple raster layers.
- Assign **weights** to input criteria (e.g., slope, land use, distance).
- Output: **suitability index raster** visualizing best candidate areas.

## Workflow:
1. Prepare input `.tif` rasters (slope.tif, landuse.tif, roads_dist.tif).
2. Assign **criteria and weights** in plugin interface.
3. Run weighted overlay to produce a **site suitability map**.
4. Export map as GeoTIFF for further analysis.

### Installation:
Plugins → Manage and Install Plugins → Search “MCDA” or “RasterMCDA” → Install.
